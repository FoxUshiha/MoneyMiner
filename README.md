You can configure the time between each mines.

You can configure how much fuel it will consume to mine.

You can configure what's the block that's considered a "Miner".

You can configure the amount that it will mine and of course, the fuels.

But first, you should put the plugin in the plugins folder and reload/restart your server :D
